# Broken Links Test Website
Simple GitHub Pages website to use for testing website broken link checkers.

Point your broken link checker at [https://frederickjh.github.io/broken-link-test-website/](https://frederickjh.github.io/broken-link-test-website/) to test it. The final slash (/) is required or Github will give you its own 404 page.
